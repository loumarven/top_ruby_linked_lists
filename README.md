# top_ruby_linked_lists

Solution to [The Odin Project's Linked Lists project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/linked-lists)

## Set-up:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run `bundle` on the project's directory to install the gem(s).

## Test notes:
1. Applied TDD in this mini project.
2. Test needs to be cleaned up (see [issue](https://github.com/loumarven/top_ruby_linked_lists/issues/1)), and will be done when I have time.
3. Run `rspec` to test.
